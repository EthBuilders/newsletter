## About

Similar to the [Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) and [Protocol Lab's (makers of IPFS)](https://github.com/ipfs/newsletter) communities, we have a grassroots newsletter that talks about the achievement of our community.

This will help:
- Highlight cool projects made by our community
- Help keep the community informed with the most up to date education via grassroots effort
- Keep people in the loop about what is going on in the Ethereum.
- Give shouts
- Post job postings

## About this Repo

- Is used to collaborate on new issues.

### Styleguide & Suggestions

- Use people's GitHub handles or their real names if they choose to. Example: "Anthony Albertorio", @tesla809.
- Try and include everyone who has made a PR or commented on an issue.
- Highlight, don't just summarize. Make a great attempt at description.
- In general, err on the side of giving credit to everyone involved. When people do the lion's share, mention them first. Something like "@skellet0r, @chanhosuh, @tesla809, etc..."
- In general, try linking larger phrases instead of single words. They're easier to notice and click on links.
- In general, try highlighting **why** something is cool. 
- Have fun!
